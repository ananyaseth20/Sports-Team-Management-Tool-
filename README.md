Summary:
Our project goal is to create a management tool for a sports organization to track their many teams and individual performance across seasons to improve operation. The domain of this project would be team management and player optimization across any sports the organization is a part of. Our database models the aspects of team management and optimization of our domain by allowing the application to be used by both Coaches, Players, and the organization itself to see game history, player performance by season, create training schedules, choose the optimal team roster for a game etc.
